# Lab01: Loops and Strings

The goal of this laboratory exercise is to learn more about the workflow involving IntelliJ for code editing and running and Git/GitHub for version control management. In addition, this lab also includes the concepts of loops and strings.

## Step 1. Cloning this laboratory

First, we need to get this project onto your computer. We do this using the `git clone` command. In the Terminal app type the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/groovy-training-logicmonitor/lab01
```

This command creates a copy of all the files in this project onto your computer. Once this operation is complete, we can then move onto opening the project in IntelliJ. First, go to IntelliJ and go to the Welcome screen by either launching the app or closing all project windows. Next, select *Checkout from Version Control*. In the dropdown, select *GitHub* and select *Password* in the *Auth Type* drop down menu. Enter your login and password credentials using the GitHub user account you gave me at the beginning of this training. Once you have logged in, copy the above URL into the *Git Repository URL* field. Then click *Clone*. You should now have the project cloned to your computer and opened in IntelliJ. You can skip to **Step 3** if you used this alternative method.

**Alternative** If you wish, you can also clone this project using IntelliJ. 

## Step 2. Opening the project in IntelliJ
